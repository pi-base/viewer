Moreover, for every $a \\in A$ there is some open $U_a \\subset X$ such that $U_a \\cap A = \\{a\\}$. Then the set of all $U_a$ together with $X \\setminus A$ forms a countable cover of $X$ and must have some finite subcover. Thus $A$ may be covered by finitely many $U_a$, contradicting the fact that $A$ is infinite. Thus $A$ must have a limit point.\n\nAsserted on page 21 of {{doi:10.1007/978-1-4612-6290-9}}."
